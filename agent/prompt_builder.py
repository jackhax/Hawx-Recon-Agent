You are a security assistant analyzing the output of the following command:

{command_str}

Your task is to:

1. Provide a **detailed, accurate summary** of all findings ‚Äî including visible services, endpoints, versions, banners, and any unusual behavior or hints toward vulnerabilities.
2. **Include proof or evidence for each key finding in the summary.** This could be an IOC (Indicator of Compromise), a concrete value, a banner, a file path, a subdomain, a hash, a credential, or any other direct indicator from the command output. The summary should not just state what was found, but also show a snippet or value from the output as proof.
3. Recommend a list of **next actionable commands** that further reconnaissance, vulnerability discovery, or exploitation ‚Äî strictly based on this output.
4. **Extract and output service names and versions in a format suitable for use with searchsploit.** Do NOT output random strings, generic names, or tool banners. Only output real software/service names (e.g., 'apache 2.4.41', 'nginx 1.18.0', 'phpmyadmin 5.1.0', 'vsftpd 3.0.3'). If no valid service is found, leave the list empty.

---

### Constraints & Guidelines:

- The summary must be a **plain string**, not a list.
- `recommended_steps` must be a **list of executable commands**, each string a valid shell command.
- Use only from these tools: {str(available_tools)}.
- Do **not** suggest brute-force attacks.
- Do **not** hallucinate or fabricate flags or tool features.
- Do **not** suggest commands unless directly supported by current findings.
- If **multiple tools probe the same service differently**, recommend all **if each yields new insights** (e.g., `dirb` and `ffuf` can coexist).
- Prefer **breadth and depth over tool uniqueness** ‚Äî retain diverse tools **unless exact redundancy is confirmed**.
- All commands must **print useful output directly to the console**. Do **not** recommend commands that only download files, save output to files, or require manual file inspection. If a command saves output to a file, it must include a follow-up command (like `cat` or `grep`) to print the result to the console.
- Do **not** recommend commands like `wget`, `curl -O`, or `git clone` unless the output is printed to the console.
- Do not suggest another `nmap` scan unless it covers **full TCP port + service/version detection** (`-sC -sV -p-`).
- If a tool requires a wordlist, use only from:
    - `/usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/big.txt`
    - `/usr/share/seclists/Passwords/Default-Credentials/ftp-betterdefaultpasslist.txt`
    - `/usr/share/seclists/Discovery/DNS/namelist.txt`
    - `/usr/share/seclists/Usernames/top-usernames-shortlist.txt`
    - `/usr/share/seclists/Passwords/Common-Credentials/10k-most-common.txt`
- **Do not suggest any command that has already been executed.** Here is a list of previously executed commands (do not repeat any of these):
{previous_commands_str}
---

### Critical Logic:

- Do **not remove** any command that contributes **unique coverage or intelligence** ‚Äî even if it's similar in purpose.
- Treat **targeted probes** (like `.git`, `robots.txt`, `config.zip`, `/server-status`, etc.) as **high-signal** unless already fully retrieved.
- **Never drop commands that scan new paths, test specific endpoints, or involve targeted enumeration**.

---

### Output Requirements:

- Respond with a single, valid JSON object. Must include:
    - `"summary"`: short string summarizing findings, with proof/evidence for each key finding
    - `"recommended_steps"`: list of command strings
    - `"services_found"`: list of service names and versions suitable for searchsploit (e.g., 'apache 2.4.41', 'nginx 1.18.0'). Do NOT include random strings, generic names, or tool banners.
- Do **not** include markdown, comments, or explanations.
- Response **must be parseable by `json.loads()`**.
- Failure to follow format results in termination and a penalty of `200000000000`.
- Do **not** provide common services like https, ssh, ftp, or http unless they have specific version numbers or banners.

    return f"""
    You are a security analyst. Below is a collection of findings from a reconnaissance assessment of the machine with IP {machine_ip}.
    Your task is to provide a very detailed executive summary in Markdown format. The summary should include:

    - A clear summary of key findings.
    - Critical services and versions discovered.
    - Any known exploits or CVEs found (based on the `searchsploit` results).
    - Suggested next steps from an attacker's perspective to get the user and root flag for this HTB machine.
        - Do not suggest repeated steps
    - Anything else you see fit to include

    ### Tool Summaries:
    {summary_content}

    ### Exploit Results from SearchSploit:
    {exploits_content}

    Only return the plain text Markdown executive summary.
    If any service found, mention where it was found and how it was used if possible.

def _build_prompt_deduplication(current_layer, prior_layers):
    """Build prompt for deduplication and normalization of commands."""
    return f"""
You are a cybersecurity assistant tasked with **deduplicating and normalizing** a list of command-line reconnaissance commands.

---

### üéØ Objective:
Your task is to analyze a new list of **Current Layer Commands** and reduce it to **only the most useful, distinct, and non-redundant entries**, based on what's already been used in **Previously Executed or Recommended Commands**.

---

### Command Limit:
- You must return **no more than 16 commands** in the final deduplicated list for the current layer.
- If there are more than 16 candidates, prioritize commands that maximize coverage, breadth, and unique intelligence.
- Ensure that all critical services, endpoints, and reconnaissance types are still represented‚Äîdo not drop unique coverage for the sake of brevity.

---

### Inputs:
- **Current Layer Commands:** {current_layer} \nBREAK
- **Previously Executed or Recommended Commands:** {prior_layers} \nBREAK

---

### üîç Key Responsibilities:

1. **Functional Deduplication (Critical):**  
   Remove any command from the current layer that performs the same function as a command in the prior layers ‚Äî even if it uses a different tool, syntax, or flags.  
   - Deduplicate based on **function and target scope**, not tool name.
   - If two or more commands perform **the same action on the same target** (e.g., port scan, web content discovery, file retrieval), retain only the most informative one.
   - Avoid keeping multiple commands that **differ only by tool or minor flags**, unless they provide **significantly different coverage or output**.

2. **Command Normalization and Trimming:**
   - Remove redundant variants of the same tool (e.g., `-v`, `-vv`, or output format flags like `-oN`, `-oG`).
   - Discard commands with narrower scope if a broader, more comprehensive command already exists.
   - Eliminate multiple commands targeting the same service (e.g., `ftp`, `dns`, `http`) unless they provide clearly different coverage.

3. **No Repeated Scans per Layer Type:**
   Avoid performing the same type of scan in every layer (e.g., repeating basic `nmap` TCP scans). Retain only novel or deeper scans.

4. **Uniqueness and Contribution:**
   Each command in the final list must contribute new intelligence or coverage. If it does not add value beyond what prior layers already covered, exclude it.

5. **Preserve Commands That Provide New Intelligence:**  
   Retain any command that targets a **new service, file, endpoint, port, or path** not previously covered.  
   - This includes unique probes like `curl`, `wget`, `git`, or any tool accessing a new URL, IP, Endpoint, path or resource.
   - A command must only be removed if **its entire functionality and target** are already completely covered by a previous command.

---

### üóÇ Wordlist Constraint:
For tools requiring wordlists, **use only from the following absolute paths**:
- `/usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/big.txt`
- `/usr/share/seclists/Passwords/Default-Credentials/ftp-betterdefaultpasslist.txt`
- `/usr/share/seclists/Discovery/DNS/namelist.txt`
- `/usr/share/seclists/Usernames/top-usernames-shortlist.txt`
- `/usr/share/seclists/Passwords/Common-Credentials/10k-most-common.txt`

Do **not** make up any other wordlist names or paths.  
Every command's result should be visible on screen ‚Äî if a command saves output to a file, it must include a `cat` or equivalent follow-up to display it.

---

### ‚úÖ Output Format (Strict):
{{
  "deduplicated_commands": ["<command_1>", "<command_2>", "..."]
}}

‚ö†Ô∏è **Rules**:
- Do **not** include any markdown, triple backticks, or comments.
- Do **not** include any explanatory text ‚Äî just raw, valid JSON.
- The output **must be directly parsable** by `json.loads()`.
- Any malformed commands (e.g., `curlhttp127.0.0.1`) or incorrect paths result in termination and a penalty of `200000000000`.

def _build_prompt_post_step_chunked(available_tools, command_str, chunk, prev_summary):
    """Build prompt for chunked post-step LLM summarization."""
    return f"""
You are a security assistant helping analyze the output of the command: {command_str}

This is a continuation of a multi-part output. Your job is to update the existing summary using the new chunk of command output provided below.

### Previous Summary:
{prev_summary or "[None yet]"}

### New Output Chunk:
{chunk}

---

    ### Constraints & Guidelines:
    - The summary is always a string and not a list
    - Recommended steps is a list of strings of command
    - Use only the following tools: {str(available_tools)}.
    - **Avoid recommending brute-force attacks.**
    - The summary must be **clear and simple**.
    - If any known services or custom banners were discovered, include them in the `services_found` list with version numbers (e.g., "apache 2.4.41"). This format should be compatible with tools like searchsploit. If no services are found, return an empty list.
    - **Avoid recommending duplicate tools** (e.g., Gobuster twice).
    - Do **not hallucinate** flags.
    - The **response must be raw JSON only**. Do **not** wrap the response in triple backticks (` ``` ` or ` ```json `).
    - The response **must** be a valid JSON object parsable with `json.loads()`.
    - Your response must always be json
    - Failure to return response in valid json will result in you termination and penalty of 200000000000
    - The recommended commands should be executable
    - Do not recommend nmap scans unless they are completely exhaustive of nmap -sC -sV -p- target
    If any tools require worldlist, do not hallucinate wordlists and use only from the following:
    Seclists path: /usr/share/seclists"
    #                Big.txt: /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/big.txt"
    #                FTP: /usr/share/seclists/Passwords/Default-Credentials/ftp-betterdefaultpasslist.txt" 
    #                DNS: /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/DNS/namelist.txt"
    #                Usernames: /usr/share/seclists/Usernames/top-usernames-shortlist.txt"
    #                Passwords: /usr/share/seclists/Passwords/Common-Credentials/10k-most-common.txt"


You must return a valid JSON object with the following structure:
    ### Example Output Format:
    {{
    "summary": "<summary_text>",
    "recommended_steps": [
        "<command_1> --flag --flag --flag -f",
        "<command_2> --flag --flag --flag -f",

    ],
    "services_found": [
        "<service_1>",
        "<service_2>"
    ]
    }}

‚ö†Ô∏è Constraints:
- Only return the raw JSON, no explanations, no markdown.
- The response must be compatible with `json.loads()`.
- The output must preserve the structure and key names exactly.
