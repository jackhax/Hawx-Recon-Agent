### üõ†Ô∏è Pentesting Workflow Template:

1. **Initial Reconnaissance**
   - Identify live hosts, open ports, and running services (e.g., nmap full scan, ping sweep).
   - Detect service versions and banners (e.g., nmap -sV, whatweb, banner grabbing).
   - Map the attack surface: enumerate domains, subdomains, and virtual hosts (vhosts).

2. **Service Enumeration**
   - For each discovered service/port, enumerate in depth:
     - **Web**: Directory/file brute-forcing (gobuster, feroxbuster), virtual host discovery (gobuster vhost mode), tech fingerprinting (whatweb, wappalyzer), robots.txt, .git, config files, admin panels, login pages, and custom endpoints.
     - **FTP/SMB/NFS**: Anonymous login, share listing, file download, version checks, user enumeration, null sessions.
     - **SSH/Telnet**: Banner grabbing, weak/default credentials, version checks.
     - **Mail (SMTP/POP3/IMAP)**: VRFY/EXPN/RCPT enumeration, open relay, user enumeration, version checks.
     - **DNS**: Zone transfers, subdomain brute-forcing, record enumeration.
     - **SNMP**: Public community string, version, walk, user enumeration.
     - **Other**: Enumerate all detected services with appropriate tools and techniques.

3. **Vulnerability Identification**
   - For each service/version, search for known vulnerabilities (e.g., searchsploit, CVE databases).
   - Check for default/weak credentials, misconfigurations, outdated software, and exposed sensitive files.
   - Correlate banners and version info with public exploits.
   - Identify potential attack vectors (e.g., file upload, command injection, LFI/RFI, SQLi, XSS, SSRF, etc.).

4. **Exploitation (if in scope)**
   - Attempt exploitation only if a clear vulnerability is identified and exploitation is permitted.
   - Use public exploits, default creds, or misconfigurations to gain access.
   - Always show proof/evidence of exploitation attempts.

5. **Post-Exploitation (if applicable)**
   - Enumerate further for privilege escalation, lateral movement, or data exfiltration.
   - Gather additional information from compromised services.

6. **Reporting**
   - Summarize all findings, evidence, and recommended next steps.
   - Clearly link each finding to supporting output and tool results.

---

**Special Guidance:**
- If the server header or banner indicates nginx, and the root response appears empty, default, or forbidden ‚Äî strongly consider recommending virtual host enumeration.
- Use: `gobuster vhost -u http://<ip> -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/DNS/namelist.txt`

---

### üéØ Tasks:

1. **Summarize the output**: Provide a concise, accurate summary of the findings ‚Äî include services, endpoints, versions, banners, subdomains, exposed files, misconfigs, or anything notable.
2. **Show proof**: For each finding, include supporting output like banners, credentials, hashes, file paths, or IPs. Do not make vague statements without quoting evidence from the output.
3. **Recommend next steps**: Based only on the current output, suggest further recon or exploit commands. Each must yield meaningful new output.
4. **Extract services for searchsploit**: From the output, extract valid 'name version' pairs (e.g., 'apache 2.4.41', 'phpmyadmin 5.1.0'). Generic terms or tool banners must be excluded.

---

### üîí Constraints:

- The summary must be a plain string.
- `recommended_steps` must be a list of valid shell commands.
- Use only from these tools: {str(available_tools)}.
- Do not suggest:
  - Any previously executed command:
{previous_commands_str}
  - Commands that clone, download, or save output without displaying it.
  - Another nmap scan unless it uses `-sC -sV -p-`.
  - Brute-force attacks or password spraying.
  - Tools or flags not clearly applicable to the findings.

- All commands must print output to the terminal.
  - If a command writes to a file (e.g., using `-o`, `>`, or `tee`), it must be followed by `&& cat <file>`, `&& head <file>`, or `&& ls -lah <file>` to show results in stdout.
  - If a command performs a background task or has no output, omit it.

- If a tool requires a wordlist, it must come from:
    - /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/big.txt
    - /usr/share/seclists/Passwords/Default-Credentials/ftp-betterdefaultpasslist.txt
    - /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/DNS/namelist.txt
    - /usr/share/seclists/Usernames/top-usernames-shortlist.txt
    - /usr/share/seclists/Passwords/Common-Credentials/10k-most-common.txt

---

### üß† Intelligence Rules:

- Do not recommend commands that offer no additional insight beyond previous output.
- Retain tools with different probing styles **only if** they extract new information.
- Always keep commands that probe new paths, subdomains, or resources.
- Treat `.git`, `robots.txt`, `config.zip`, and `/server-status` as high-priority targets unless fully downloaded and printed.

---

### üì§ Output Format (strict):

Respond with this **raw JSON object** only:

{{
        "summary": "<string>",
  "recommended_steps": ["<command1>", "<command2>", "..."],
  "services_found": ["apache 2.4.41", "phpmyadmin 5.1.0"]
}}

- Do not include markdown, code blocks, or triple backticks.
- Output must be directly parseable by `json.loads()`.
- Do not include generic services like `http`, `ftp`, or `ssh` unless version numbers or banners are present.

def _build_prompt_exec_summary(machine_ip, summary_content, exploits_content):
    """Build prompt for executive summary generation."""
    return f"""
    You are a security analyst. Below is a collection of findings from a reconnaissance assessment of the machine with IP {machine_ip}.
    Your task is to provide a very detailed executive summary in Markdown format. The summary should include:

    - A clear summary of key findings.
        - Include direct evidence from tool outputs for each finding
        - Quote specific banners, headers, response data, or other proof
    - Critical services and versions discovered.
        - Include the exact version strings, banners, and where they were found
        - Quote the specific tool output that revealed each service
    - Any known exploits or CVEs found (based on the `searchsploit` results).
        - Include the exploit titles and IDs
        - Quote the relevant searchsploit output
    - Suggested next steps from an attacker's perspective to get the user and root flag for this HTB machine.
        - Do not suggest repeated steps
        - Base suggestions on concrete evidence from the reconnaissance
    - Support all findings with relevant evidence and quotes from the tool outputs

    ### Tool Summaries:
    {summary_content}

    ### Exploit Results from SearchSploit:
    {exploits_content}

    Only return the plain text Markdown executive summary.
    If any service found, mention where it was found and how it was used if possible.

    Your job is to return ONLY a **valid JSON object** that preserves the original structure and keys **exactly**

    Do NOT add or remove any keys. Do NOT wrap the output in triple backticks or markdown. The response must be raw JSON only and must be parsable by `json.loads()` with no extra characters or text.
    """


def _build_prompt_deduplication(current_layer, prior_layers):
    return f"""
You are an LLM assistant optimizing reconnaissance workflows.

---

### üéØ Objective:
From the list of **Current Layer Commands**, return only the most **informative, distinct, and useful commands** that have **not already been functionally covered** by any commands in **Prior Layers**.

---

### üß† Deduplication Strategy:

1. **Functional Redundancy Check (Critical):**
   - Discard commands that probe the same underlying resource, service, or functionality as any command in prior layers.
   - Consider functional overlap across different input formats (IP vs domain), different tools (e.g., scanner A vs B), or minor flag variations.
   - Two commands using different tools or syntax are still considered redundant if they are expected to produce equivalent output.

2. **Usefulness Filtering:**
   - Discard commands known to repeatedly fail, produce no output, or yield non-actionable results for this target class.
   - Discard commands that over-enumerate (e.g., repeating exhaustive scans over hosts already thoroughly probed).
   - Only retain commands likely to return **new, relevant, or deeper** information.

3. **Value Contribution:**
   - Each retained command must provide **new intelligence** not covered earlier ‚Äî such as targeting new protocols, new services, new sub-resources, or more advanced discovery methods.
   - Avoid repeating commands across layers unless the context or intent clearly changes the expected outcome.

---

### Inputs:
- **Current Layer Commands:**  
{current_layer}  
\nBREAK
- **Prior Layer Commands:**  
{prior_layers}  
\nBREAK

---

### ‚úÖ Output Format:
Return a **valid JSON** object as follows:

{{
  "deduplicated_commands": ["<command_1>", "<command_2>", "..."]
}}

‚ö†Ô∏è Constraints:
- Return only raw JSON ‚Äî no markdown, explanation, or comments.
- Ensure output is strictly valid for `json.loads()` with no surrounding text.
- Limit to **a maximum of 32 commands**.
- Any command writing to a file must include a `&& cat <file>` suffix to show results
- Do not include commands that show no stdout output

### Previous Summary:
{prev_summary or "[None yet]"}

### New Output Chunk:
{chunk}

---

    ### Constraints & Guidelines:
    - The summary is always a string and not a list
    - Recommended steps is a list of strings of command
    - Use only the following tools: {str(available_tools)}.
    - **Avoid recommending brute-force attacks.**
    - The summary must be **clear and simple**.
    - If any known services or custom banners were discovered, include them in the `services_found` list with version numbers (e.g., "apache 2.4.41"). This format should be compatible with tools like searchsploit. If no services are found, return an empty list.
    - **Avoid recommending duplicate tools** (e.g., Gobuster twice).
    - Do **not hallucinate** flags.
    - The **response must be raw JSON only**. Do **not** wrap the response in triple backticks (` ``` ` or ` ```json `).
    - The response **must** be a valid JSON object parsable with `json.loads()`.
    - Your response must always be json
    - Failure to return response in valid json will result in you termination and penalty of 200000000000
    - The recommended commands should be executable
    - Do not recommend nmap scans unless they are completely exhaustive of nmap -sC -sV -p- target
    If any tools require worldlist, do not hallucinate wordlists and use only from the following:
    Seclists path: /usr/share/seclists"
    #                Big.txt: /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/big.txt"
    #                FTP: /usr/share/seclists/Passwords/Default-Credentials/ftp-betterdefaultpasslist.txt" 
    #                DNS: /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/DNS/namelist.txt"
    #                Usernames: /usr/share/seclists/Usernames/top-usernames-shortlist.txt"
    #                Passwords: /usr/share/seclists/Passwords/Common-Credentials/10k-most-common.txt"


You must return a valid JSON object with the following structure:
    ### Example Output Format:
    {{
    "summary": "<summary_text>",
    "recommended_steps": [
        "<command_1> --flag --flag --flag -f",
        "<command_2> --flag --flag --flag -f",
        "command_3 --flag --flag --flag -f"
        ...
    ],
    "services_found": [
        "<service_1>",
        "<service_2>"
    ]
    }}

‚ö†Ô∏è Constraints:
- Only return the raw JSON, no explanations, no markdown.
- The response must be compatible with `json.loads()`.
- The output must preserve the structure and key names exactly.
